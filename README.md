# My Starred Repositories

With my repository [Pentest-tools](https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Pentest-Tools) the idea was to use this as an alternative search for useful repositories, as the stars section has limited filter capabilities on Github.
The additional information of the description is really helpfull here, so that's why I created ths original repo. It's possible there to just search for content via `STRG + F` and find more than with the default filter settings. Doing the categorzation however was lot of efford manually.

This is on the other hand side way faster and automated:

```python
import requests

github_username = "<username>"  # Replace with your GitHub username

def get_starred_repos(username):
    starred_repos = []
    page = 1
    per_page = 100
    
    while True:
        url = f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}/starred?per_page={per_page}&page={page}"
        try:
            response = requests.get(url) 
            if response.status_code == 403:
                print("API rate limit exceeded. Stopping further requests.")
                break
            if response.status_code != 200:
                print(f"Error fetching starred repositories. Status code: {response.status_code}")
                print(f"Response content: {response.content}")
                break
            
            data = response.json()
            if not data:
                break
            
            for repo in data:
                starred_repos.append({
                    "name": repo["name"],
                    "url": repo["html_url"],
                    "description": repo.get("description", "No description provided.")
                })
            
            page += 1
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Request failed: {e}")
            break
    
    return starred_repos

def save_readme(starred_repos):
    readme_content = "# My Starred Repositories\n\n"
    for repo in starred_repos:
        readme_content += f"- [{repo['name']}]({repo['url']}): {repo['description']}\n"
    
    with open("README.md", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(readme_content)
    print("README.md has been created in the current working directory.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    starred_repos = get_starred_repos(github_username)
    if starred_repos:
        save_readme(starred_repos)
```

With authentication it can be extended to also e.G. filter by language, add the repo README content up to line x or whatever. But for now and 5 minutes effort I'm happy with this :-)
